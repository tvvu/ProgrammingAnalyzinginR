Assignment 1
The goal of the 􏰄rst substantive assignment is to get started on using R for your own research.
􏰀 Choose a topic or problem that you are currently working on or that you previously solved using a di􏰃erent statistics package.
􏰀 Write down what the data is; what question you want to 􏰁ask􏰂 the data (hypotheses, research questions, etc); and what analyses you wil need to get the answers.
􏰀 Write an R script to read your data into R. Explore the shape and contents of your data. Is there an internal structure? How many data frames do you have? What data types do the columns have?
􏰀 Make a number of tables to show your data and explain what they mean

```{r}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(foreign) #call package foreign in order to use read.spss
Exp1 <- read.spss("DATA_Exp1_compact_correct67_outliers_1.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE) #read in data


#Problem: ANOVA (IVs: within-subject Director, between-subject Condition; DV: accuracy)
#Problem: ANOVA (IVs: within-subject Director, between-subject Condition; DV: perspective-taking errors)
#Problem: ANOVA (IVs: within-subject Director, between-subject Condition; DV: RT)

#First I need to create the variable: accuracy for experimental trials

Exp1_ordered <-Exp1[,order(colnames(Exp1))]
Exp1_cols <- colnames(Exp1_ordered)

Exp1[,"ParticipantClickObject1.ACC.1"] #to subset 1 varible, testing how subsetting works
colACC = paste("ParticipantClickObject1.ACC", 1:24, sep=".") #create a list of experimental ACC variables
Exp1_ACC <- Exp1[ , c("Subject",colACC)] #subset the experimental ACC columns

head(Exp1_ACC)

colRT= paste("ParticipantClickObject1.RT", 1:24, sep=".") #create a list of experimental ACC variables
Exp1_RT <- Exp1[ , c("Subject",colRT)] #subset the experimental ACC columns

head(Exp1_RT)


m.Exp1_ACC <- melt(Exp1_ACC,id.vars="Subject") #melt the ACC data into long format
head(m.Exp1_ACC)

m.Exp1_RT <- melt(Exp1_RT,id.vars="Subject") #melt the RT data into long format
head(m.Exp1_RT)

m.Exp1_ACC$variable <- as.numeric(gsub("ParticipantClickObject1.ACC.", "", m.Exp1_ACC$variable)) #get rid of the text "ParticipantClickbObject1."
head(m.Exp1_RT)
m.Exp1_RT$variable <- as.numeric(gsub("ParticipantClickObject1.RT.", "", m.Exp1_RT$variable))

colnames(m.Exp1_ACC) <- c("Subject","Trial","ACC")
colnames(m.Exp1_RT) <- c("Subject","Trial","RT")

merged <- arrange(merge(m.Exp1_ACC,m.Exp1_RT), Subject, Trial)

head(merged)

summary(merged)

meanRT <- aggregate(merged["RT"], by = merged[,c("ACC","Subject"), drop = F], FUN = mean)

meanACC <- aggregate(merged["ACC"], by = merged[,c("Subject"), drop = F], FUN = mean)

meanACCperTrial <- aggregate(merged["ACC"], by = merged[,c("Trial"), drop = F], FUN = mean)



#Then I need to create the variable: perspective-taking error

#Then I need to calculate the mean RT for only the correct trials

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
