```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

##Watch out for the classes of objects

dataframe[, "variable"] #this returns a vector
dataframe["variable"] #this returns a data frame

##New thing: regular expressions to clean the format of data

d$time = gsub("[^0-9.","", d$time) #in the variable time in the dataframe d, find anything that is not a number and not a comma and replace them with nothing (so, to strip them off) 


#I got sick and had to go early, but then the last part was tricky for people so they repeated it at the beginning of Day3

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
