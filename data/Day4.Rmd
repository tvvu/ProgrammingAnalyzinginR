## Day 4


```{r}

#recap of Day 3

#Good advice: When you created functions they only exist in the environment. Better write complex functions in seperate functions.r files. 
#And then source the function whenever needed by using the method source()


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
